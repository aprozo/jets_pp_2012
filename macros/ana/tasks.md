# Tasks

## 25.03.2025
- [x] Add trigger efficiency histograms
- [x] Correct spectra by trigger efficicency + jet finder
- [x] Plot HT2 and JP2 together
- [x] Event cuts - accepted event ratio
- [x] Plot vertex distribution position histograms
- [x] Check BEMC tower id


## 15.04.2025
Presentation plan

- Reconstruction efficiency(after), Trigger efficiency(before unfolding)
- Compare efficiency for MB, JP2, HT2
- Check only charged jets
- plot mc pt vs reco XSEC weights
- unfolding chi2 percentage check


embedding:
- weight by XSEC
- check max pt
- matching before hadd
